# React Stopwatch App

This is a simple and elegant React-based Stopwatch application that allows users to measure elapsed time with precision. The application provides start, stop, and reset functionalities, making it a perfect tool for timing activities with millisecond accuracy.

## Features

- **Precise Time Measurement**: The stopwatch tracks time up to the millisecond, ensuring accurate timing for various tasks.
- **Interactive Controls**: The app includes start, stop, and reset buttons, allowing users to control the stopwatch easily.
- **Responsive and Accessible UI**: The design is responsive and user-friendly, with large, clear buttons and a stylish display for the elapsed time.
- **Clean and Minimalist Design**: The app's interface is simple yet aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on functionality and ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and handling component states.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for managing the stopwatch's functionality.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application, including responsive design and interactive button states.

## How It Works

1. **State Management**: The app uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the stopwatch's running state and the elapsed time.
2. **Time Calculation**: The elapsed time is calculated in milliseconds and formatted into minutes, seconds, and milliseconds for display.
3. **User Interaction**: The app includes buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch, each with an associated function to handle the interaction.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app locally with `npm start`.
4. The app will open in your browser. Click the **Start** button to begin timing, **Stop** to pause, and **Reset** to clear the time.
